## Expense Manager

A web-based personal finance dashboard for tracking, visualizing, and reporting everyday expenses. Built with a Python (Flask/Django) backend, Expense Manager gives users a fast way to log spending and see trends at a glance.

# Features

Interactive Dashboard — A live line chart on the Home page plots total expenses across the days of the week, making spending spikes and dips easy to spot.
Add Expenses — Quick-entry form for logging new transactions as they happen.
Reports — Detailed breakdowns of spending, with dedicated saved report views:

Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly

Date-Range Filtering — Toggle the dashboard view between reporting periods (e.g. "This week").
Share & Export — Export expense data or share reports directly from the dashboard, useful for budget reviews or handing records off to an accountant.
User Details — Manage account/profile information.

# Tech Stack
